## Carraway Farms
Carraway Farms is an example promotional site for an organic farm in Norfolk; it gives details of the work the farm does along with the products and services it can supply.

There is a gallery of informational cards that describe the different vegetables that you could buy, an information panel that describes the services that the farm provides and a section that gives the contact details and background of the farm.

The site is fully responsive with a flex box picture gallery and a hamburger style pop-out nav-bar.
